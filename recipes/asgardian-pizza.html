<h2><em>Ingredients:</em></h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mölnir Dough</strong>: Homemade or store-bought</li>
    <li><strong>Odin’s Tomato Sauce</strong>: Rich and flavorful, preferably homemade</li>
    <li><strong>Valhalla Mozzarella</strong>: Fresh and creamy</li>
    <li><strong>Basil of the Gods</strong>: For a touch of green and flavor</li>
    <li><strong>Elven Olive Oil</strong>: Extra virgin for drizzling</li>
    <li><strong>Thor’s Sea Salt</strong>: To taste</li>
    <li><strong>Loki’s Garlic</strong>: Minced, for an extra kick</li>
    <li><strong>Heimdall’s Parmesan</strong>: Grated, for a finishing touch</li>
    <li><strong>Flour of the Nine Realms</strong>: For dusting the dough and achieving a slightly charred crust</li>
</ul>

<h2><em>Steps:</em></h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Mjölnir Dough</strong>: Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface until it’s about 
        12 inches in diameter. Make sure the edges are slightly thicker to hold the toppings.</li>
    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong>: Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible (usually around 500°F or 260°C). 
        If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Odin’s Tomato Sauce</strong>: Spread a generous layer of tomato sauce over the dough, 
        leaving about an inch around the edges for the crust.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Valhalla Mozzarella</strong>: Tear the buffalo mozzarella into pieces and scatter them evenly over the sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Season with Loki’s Garlic and Thor’s Sea Salt</strong>: Sprinkle minced garlic and sea salt over the pizza. 
        Drizzle a bit of Elven Olive Oil on top.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake the Pizza</strong>: Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or onto the pizza stone). 
        Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and slightly charred, and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Basil of the Gods</strong>: Once the pizza is out of the oven, scatter fresh basil leaves on top. 
        The residual heat will slightly wilt the basil, releasing its aroma.</li>
    <li><strong>Finish with Heimdall’s Parmesan</strong>: Grate some Parmesan cheese over the top for an extra layer of flavor.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve</strong>:  Slice and serve your Asgardian Pizza hot, and enjoy the divine flavors!</li>
